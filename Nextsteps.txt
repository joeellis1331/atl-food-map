utils_choropleth.py
- Figure out how to handle where there is only one rating in an area (will misrepresent for sure)

utils_map_elements.py
- add a new filter group to go by star rating and fully plant based
- add a search function to zoom in on an address
    - mile search radius within that address?
    - maybe even a route finding function?

Main.py
- Is there a way to not have to re-run the geocoding every time?
- capture errors into a log file
